# Scenario

You are a security analyst working for a social media organization. The organization recently experienced a major data breach, which compromised the safety of their customers’ personal information, such as names and addresses. Your organization wants to implement strong network hardening practices that can be performed consistently to prevent attacks and breaches in the future.

After inspecting the organization’s network, you discover four major vulnerabilities. The four vulnerabilities are as follows:

The organization’s employees' share passwords.

The admin password for the database is set to the default.

The firewalls do not have rules in place to filter traffic coming in and out of the network.

Multifactor authentication (MFA) is not used.

If no action is taken to address these vulnerabilities, the organization is at risk of experiencing another data breach or other attacks in the future.

# Security Risk Assessment Report

## Part 1: Select up to three hardening tools and methods to implement

- Password policies

- Multifactor authentication

- Port filtering

## Part 2: Explain your recommendations

According to the organization's current situation, the first recommendation I have to make is to implement a strong password policy. This will increase the security by making it harder for attackers to steal or guess credentials. This only needs to be implemented once, and no need to update it, unless you are looking higher level of security.

Next is the use of Multifactor Authentication, this will add an extra step to the login in exhange for even increased security, making it near impossible for an attacker to log into an account if he doesn't know the MFA. MFA only needs to be implemented once, and each user will be able to set it up for themselves afterwards.

Lastly, port filtering will reduce stress on the network and increase security, by rejecting traffic directed to unused ports. Port filtering is implemented once, and updated if new services that use disabled ports are added.

These are only the first steps towards having a robust security posture.
